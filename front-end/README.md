# Eat, Drink, What!

Eat, Drink, What! is an app made for bringing people together and having fun about town, whether that be with food, drink, or summersaults at the park! Once you create an account you have access to a bulletin board of events posted by others who also have an account. You'll be able to see the title of the event, the location, the date, and the time. The host of the event might choose to keep their identity hidden, but that just means you might make some new and unexpected friends! There is no posting or direct messaging because we'd like to encourage you to discard your hermit ways (for a short time at least) and become part of the world.
