        <h3 id="thirteen">13) Dispute Resolution Section</h3>
        <h4>In the unlikely event that we have a legal dispute, here is how the Parties agree to proceed, except where prohibited by applicable law.</h4>

        <p>Any subsection in this Dispute Resolution Section that is prohibited by law shall not apply to the users residing in that jurisdiction.</p>

        <h6 class="text-center">INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION</h6>

        <p>If you are dissatisfied with our Service for any reason, please contact us through the Questions link in the footer first so we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside assistance. If you choose to puruse a dispute, claim, or controversy against Eat, Drink, What!, these terms will apply. For purposes of this dispute resolution process and arbitration procedures set forth in section 13 Eat, Drink, What! shall include our affiliates, employees, licensors, and service providers.</p>

        <p>Eat, Drink, What! values its relationship with you and appreciates the mutual benefit realized from informally resolving disputes (as defined below). Before formally pursuing a dispute in arbitration or small claims court, you agree to first send a detailed notice to Eat, Drink, What! through the Question link in the footer, which will be forwarded to our legal counsel. If Eat, Drink, What! has a dispute with you, Eat, Drink, What! agrees to first send a notice to you at your most recent email address on file with us.</p>

        <p>Your notice must contain all of the following information, and Eat, Drink, What! will include the same information and signature if the dispute originates from the Service:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>your full name</li>
            <li>information that enables Eat, Drink, What! to identify your account, including a picture or screenshot of your profile, your address, mobile phone number, email address, and date of birth you used to register your account</li>
            <li>a detailed description of your dispute, including the nature and factual basis of your claim</li>
            <li>the relief you are personally seeking with a corresponding calculation of your alleged damages(if any)</li>
            <li>your signature on this dispute notice</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You and Eat, Drink, What! agree to then negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the dispute. As part of these good faith negotiations, if Eat, Drink, What! requests a telephone conference with you to discuss your dispute, you agree to personally participate, with your attorney, if you are represented by counsel. Likewise, if you request a telephone conference to discuss Eat, Drink, What!'s dispute with you, Eat, Drink, What! agrees to have one representative participate</p>

        <p>This informal process should lead to a resolution of the dispute. However, if the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a fully completed notice and the Parties have not otherwise mutually agreed to an extension of this informal dispute resolution time period, you or Eat, Drink, What! may initiate an arbitration (subject to a Party's right to elect small claims court as provided below).</p>

        <p>Completion of this informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration or small claims court action. Failure to do so is a breach of this Agreement. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while you and Eat, Drink, What! engage in this informal dispute resolution process. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider, National Arbitration and Mediation ("NAM"), shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any arbitration unless the Party bringing such demand for arbitration can certify in writing that the terms and conditions of this informal dispute resolution process were fully satisfied. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this provision and to enjoin any arbitration proceeding or small claims court action.</p>

        <h6 class="text-center">INDIVIDUAL RELIEF: CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER</h6>

        <p>To the fullest extent allowable by law, you and Eat, Drink, What! each waive the right to a jury trial and the right to litigate disputes in court in favor of individual arbitration (except for small claims court as provided above). You and Eat, Drink, What! each waive the right to file or participate in a class action against the other or otherwise to seek relief on a class basis, including any currently pending actions against Eat, Drink, What!</p>

        <p>To the fullest extent allowable by law, there shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated or litigated on a class, collective, representative, consolidated, or private attorney general basis. The arbitrator can award the same relief available in court provided that the arbitrator may only award final relief (including injunctive or declaratory relief) in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide final relief warranted by that individual Party's claim.</p>

        <p>The arbitrator may not award final relief for, against, or on behalf of anyone who is not a Party to the arbitration on a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general basis. If a court determines that any of these prohibitions in this paragraph are unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), and all appeals of that decision are exhausted or the decision is otherwise final, then you and Eat, Drink, What! agree that that particular claim or request for relief shall proceed in court but shall be stayed pending individual arbitration of the remaining claims of relief that you have brought.</p>

        <p>If this specific sub-section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision (except the jury trial waiver and the informal dispute resolution process) shall be null and void. This sub-section is an essential part of this arbitration agreement.</p>

        <h6 class="text-center">DISPUTE RESOLUTION THROUGH ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT</h6>

        <p>Any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Eat, Drink, What! (that is not resolved informally by Eat, Drink, What! or as provided under the sub-section above) that arises from or relates in any way to this agreement (including any alleged breach of this agreement), the Service, or our relationship with you (collectively, "Dispute"), shall be exclusively resolved through <strong>binding individual arbitration</strong> except as specifically provided otherwise in this dispute resolution section. "Dispute" as used in this agreement shall have the broadest possible meaning and include claims that arose before the existence of this or any prior agreement and claims that arise during the term of this agreement or after the termination of this agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Eat, Drink, What! may elect to have an individual claim heard in small claims court.</p>

        <p>If the request to proceed in small claims court is made after an arbitration has been initiated but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed. Any controversy over the small claims court's jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court. All other issues (except as otherwise provided herein) are exclusively for the arbitrator to decide, including but not limited to scope and enforceability of this dispute resolution section, as well as any request to proceed in small claims court that is made after an arbitrator has been appointed.</p>

        <p>If you or Eat, Drink, What! challenges the small claims court election in your dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this agreement as to your dispute. However, such court determination shall not be considered or deemed binding with respect to Eat, Drink, What!'s other contracting parties.</p>

        <p>Any court proceeding to enforce this dispute resolution section 13, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, must be commenced in accordance with section 15. In the event dispute resolution section 13 is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Eat, Drink, What! (except for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby irrevocably consent to those courts' exercise of personal jurisdiction over you for such purposes and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.</p>

        <h6 class="text-center">INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND MASS ARBITRATION PROTOCOLS</h6>

        <p>This subsection applies to Disputes that are submitted to NAM (National Arbitration and Mediation) after fully completing the informal notice and dispute resolution process described in subsection INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS above and when no small claims court election is made by either Party. Any arbitration between you and Eat, Drink, What! shall be administered by NAM in accordance with NAM's operative Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (the "NAM" rules) in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, as modified by this section 13. For a copy of the NAM rules, please visit https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms or contact NAM's National Processing Center at 990 Stewart Avenue, 1st Floor, Garden City, NY 11530 and email address commercial@namadr.com.</p>

        <p>If NAM is unable or unwilling to perform its duties under this agreement, the Parties shall mutually agree on an alternative administor that will replace NAM and assume NAM's role consistent with this agreement. If the Parties are unable to agree, they will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will assume NAM's duties under this agreement.</p>

        <p>The Parties agree that the following procedures will apply to any arbitrations initiated under this dispute resolution section 13:</p>

        <h6>1) Commencing an Arbitration</h6>
        <p>To initiate an arbitration, you or Eat, Drink, What! shall send to NAM a demand for arbitration ("Demand for Arbitration") that describes the claim(s) and request for relief in detail, consistent with the requirements in this agreement and NAM rules. If you send a Demand for Arbitration, you shall also send it to Eat, Drink, What! at events@eatdrinkwhat.com within 10 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration to NAM. If Eat, Drink, What! sends a Demand for Arbitration, we will also send it to your email address on file with us within the same 10 day period. The arbitration provider shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any such demand for arbitration that fails to certify in writing that the Party meets the requirements of dispute resolution section 13 or if either Party elects small claims court as set forth above.</p>

        <h6>2) Fees</h6>
        <p>The payment of all fees shall be governed by the NAM rules, except to the extent that the case is a part of a mass filing (as defined below) or the NAM fees and costs (including arbitrator fees) paid by either Party are reallocated upon order of the arbitrator following a determination that (a) either Party breached section 13 of this agreement, (b) such reallocation is called for under this agreement, or (c) reallocation is otherwise permitted under applicable law. Upon a showing to Eat, Drink, What! of your financial hardship we will consider a good faith request made by you to pay your portion of the applicable consumer portion of the filing fee. Eat, Drink, What! is committed to ensuring that arbitration costs to consumers do not serve as a barrier to the adjudication of disputes. If Eat, Drink, What! initiates an arbitration against you, we shall pay all fees.</p>

        <h6>3) The Arbitrator</h6>
        <p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator (the "Claim Arbitrator"), as assisted by any process arbitrator appointed under NAM rules. (The term "Arbitrator" applies to both the claim arbitrator and the process arbitrator). If a hearing is elected by either Party, the arbitrator shall be in or close to the location in which you reside. The arbitrator is bound by and shall adhere to this agreement. In the event NAM rules conflict with this agreement, the terms of this agreement shall control. If the arbitrator determines that strict application of any term of section 13 of this agreement (except for the small claims election, which shall be determined by the small claims court) would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration (the "Unfair Term"), then the arbitrator shall have authority to modify the Unfair Term to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the agreement (the "Modified Term"). In determining the substance of a Modified Term, the arbitrator shall select a term that comes closest to expressing the intention of the Unfair Term.</p>

        <h6>4) Dispositive Motions</h6>
        <p>The Parties agree that the Claim Arbitrator shall have the authority to consider dispositive motions without an oral evidentiary hearing. Dispositive motions may be requested under the following circumstances: (a) within 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator's appointment, a party may request to file a dispositive motion based upon the pleadings; and (b) no later than 30 days prior to the evidentiary hearing, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion for summary judgement based upon the Parties' pleadings and the evidence submitted.</p>

        <h6>5) Discovery</h6>
        <p>Each Party may (a) serve up to five requests for relevant, non-privileged documents from the other Party; and (b) request that the other Party provide verified responses to no more than 5 relevant interrogatories (including subparts). Unless both Parties agree otherwise, no other forms of discovery (including depositions) may be utilized. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other Party within 21 days after the Claim Arbitrator's appointment. The responding Party shall provide the requesting Party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, responses signed by the Party themselves to the requested interrogatories, and/or any objections to the requests within 30 days after receipt of the requests, or, in the event of an objection to any discovery request, 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator resolves the dispute.</p>
        <p>In the event either Party requests that the Claim Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion on the pleadings, such written discovery response deadlines shall be extended until 30 days following the Claim Arbitrator's final decision on such dispositive motion. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the Claim Arbitrator for resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the Claim Arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort that would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.</p>


        <h6>6) Confidentiality</h6>
        <p>Upon either Party's request, the Arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either Party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal.</p>


        <h6>7) Arbitration Hearing</h6>
        <p>You and Eat, Drink, What! are entitled to a fair evidentiary hearing (i.e. trial) before the Claim Arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings are usually simpler, less costly, and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. The Parties agree to waive all oral hearings and instead submit all disputes to the Claim Arbitrator for an award based on written submissions and other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a Party requests an oral hearing within 10 days after the Respondant files a response. If an oral evidentiary hearing is requested, both Parties must be personally present at the hearing, regardless of whether either Party has retained counsel. Both Parties must personally attend the hearing. Either Party's failure to personally attend the hearing, without a countinuance ordered by the Claim Arbitrator for good cause, will result in a default judgement taken against that Party.</p>


        <h6>8) Arbitration Award</h6>
        <p>Regardless of the format of the arbitration, the Claim Arbitrator shall provide a reasoned decision, in writing within 30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing is held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons of the award. The arbitration award is binding only between you and Eat, Drink, What! and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different Party. The Claim Arbitrator may, however, choose to consider rulings from other arbitrations involving a different Party. The Arbitrator may award fees and costs as provided by the NAM Rules or to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court. This includes but is not limited to the ability of the Arbitrator to award fees and costs if the Arbitrator determines that a claim or defense is frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose, for the purpose of harassment, or in bad faith.</p>


        <h6>9) Offer of Settlement</h6>
        <p>The Respondant may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer to the opposing Party any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted.</p>
